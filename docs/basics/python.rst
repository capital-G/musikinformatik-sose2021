Python basics
=============

To not exceed the scope of this course we will refer to external
resources to learn *Python*.
As we are focussing on local experiments we do not need to
rely on advanced software engineering skills, although some fundamentals
are required such as

* Functions
* Scope of variables
* Control flows (``if``, ``for``)
* Basic understanding of object oriented programming

Here is a list of online resources that are worth checking out:

* `Programmierkurs @ RSH DÃ¼sseldorf <https://capital-g.github.io/programmierkurs/>`_
  is a course in german where the basic fundaments of programming are taught using
  the programming language Python.

* `realpython.com <https://realpython.com/>`_ is a good website which covers basic
  and advanced topics.

* The `official tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_ is also worth
  checking out.
