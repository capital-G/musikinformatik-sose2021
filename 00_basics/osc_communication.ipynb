    "# Communicating between SuperCollider and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One may ask the question why there are so many different programming languages in the first place is valid.\n",
    "One of the reasons is that certain programming languages follow ceration aproaches that fit certain domain specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming language *sclang* of SuperCollider platform is an *interpreted* language which means [each instruction gets dynamically evaluated](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3265602/3475778).\n",
    "Of course there is the question how *sclang* itself has been written which is C++, a *compiled* language.\n",
    "Basically compiled languages have the advantage of being fast where interpreted languages allow for a more dynamic aproach which comes handy during live situations but are therefore slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "As audio processing is time critical (see [real time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)) we need a fast language (C++) to generate the audio signal but we want also a language on a more abstract level to control the audio generation and not care about e.g. memory allocation, which *sclang* delivers.\n",
    "A different aproach is used by e.g. [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) in which one programs directly in C++ but *openFrameworks* delivers convenience function for often used tasks - this aproach is often called a library or framework and is not a new programming language like *sclang*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As *sclang* itself is not fast enough to generate audio signals we need to send send control commands to the audio generating server *scsynth* which is written in C++.\n",
    "In order to communicate between both entities *sclang* and *scsynth* uses *OSC* (Open Sounc Control) which defines a protocol to send data between both entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Drawing](scsynth_sclang.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we now have lurked into the topic of the motivation behind the multitude of programming languages we now introduce a new programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "The first paragraph of the [Wikipedia article about Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) says\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds great, but as it is an interpreted language it is still not fast enough for audio generation like *scsynth* and as it is not designed specifically to control audio synthesis like *sclang* but nonetheless it has the advantage that a lot of people adapt a variety of applications and libraries for Python.\n",
    "In particular Python gained popularity within the last years as it is the de-facto standard for data analysis as lots Data Science and Machine Learning applications rely on the simplicity and readability of Python.\n",
    "We could implement these algorithms in sclang as both languages are turing complete but this is a big task as these algorithms can be tricky to implement properly so we need to find a way to communicate between both languages what this chapter is about."
