    "# Communicating between SuperCollider and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One may ask the question why there are so many different programming languages in the first place is valid.\n",
    "One of the reasons is that certain programming languages follow ceration aproaches that fit certain domain specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming language *sclang* of SuperCollider platform is an *interpreted* language which means [each instruction gets dynamically evaluated](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3265602/3475778).\n",
    "Of course there is the question how *sclang* itself has been written which is C++, a *compiled* language.\n",
    "Basically compiled languages have the advantage of being fast where interpreted languages allow for a more dynamic aproach which comes handy during live situations but are therefore slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "As audio processing is time critical (see [real time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)) we need a fast language (C++) to generate the audio signal but we want also a language on a more abstract level to control the audio generation and not care about e.g. memory allocation, which *sclang* delivers.\n",
    "A different aproach is used by e.g. [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) in which one programs directly in C++ but *openFrameworks* delivers convenience function for often used tasks - this aproach is often called a library or framework and is not a new programming language like *sclang*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As *sclang* itself is not fast enough to generate audio signals we need to send send control commands to the audio generating server *scsynth* which is written in C++.\n",
    "In order to communicate between both entities *sclang* and *scsynth* uses *OSC* (Open Sounc Control) which defines a protocol to send data between both entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Drawing](scsynth_sclang.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we now have lurked into the topic of the motivation behind the multitude of programming languages we now introduce a new programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "The first paragraph of the [Wikipedia article about Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) says\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds great, but as it is an interpreted language it is still not fast enough for audio generation like *scsynth* and as it is not designed specifically to control audio synthesis like *sclang* but nonetheless it has the advantage that a lot of people adapt a variety of applications and libraries for Python.\n",
    "In particular Python gained popularity within the last years as it is the de-facto standard for data analysis as lots Data Science and Machine Learning applications rely on the simplicity and readability of Python.\n",
    "We could implement these algorithms in sclang as both languages are turing complete but this is a big task as these algorithms can be tricky to implement properly so we need to find a way to communicate between both languages what this chapter is about."

    "There are a variety of formats to exchange and store information.\n",
    "One of the most commonly used is JSON which found wide adaption because it mimics the data structure of JavaScript which is the only available programming language in browsers.\n",
    "In SuperCollider and Python the data structure of JSON is closely related to a dictionary, where under a *key* (traditionally a string) a *value* is stored which makes accessing data properties more easy than in an array.\n",
    "OSC on the other hand is more related to a list which lacks the mapping of its items because I need to know what the first, secound, ... value actually represents and I can not change this order without modifying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although OSC can also be stored as a file it is used most of the time in a network domain.\n",
    "JSON finds adaption in networking and in file storage and trades human-readability for performance by not relying on a binary encoding for its messages like OSC and instead using human readable string representations for its data, therefore we can take a look at an example JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"key_a\": \"value\",\n",
    "    \"key_b\": [1, 2, 3],\n",

    "        \"nested_key\": 42.0\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting dictionaries and storing arrays are really handy and [are not (well) supported by OSC](https://doc.sccode.org/Guides/OSC_communication.html).\n",
    "Another benefit is that we can store large data in JSON (multiple GBs are not uncommon but also not the best format for such endeavours) which gets difficult when relying on the OSC network protocol UDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before the SuperCollider environment is built around OSC and although we can set up easily an OSC server and client in sclang it is [not possible](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/5310) to set up a server or client which responds to something differently than OSC (keep in mind that quarks like [API](https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/API) set up a server in another language and this server will transfer the data back to sclang via OSC).\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that we can not use JSON in SuperCollider but only through exchanging files by using [`parseYAMLFile`](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/String.html#-parseYAMLFile) (a bit misleading as this YAML is another format like JSON but the YAML parser can parse JSON and YAML - `parseJSON` was added in SC 3.11).\n",
    "\n",
    "```supercollider\n",
    "j = \"example.json\".parseYAMLFile;\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of the usual dimensionality reduction on the time domain we want to reduce the number of frequency bins of $S$ this time because we want to keep the number of grains so they are deterministic and we can schedule them easily.\n",

    "This matrix $T$ is not a quadratic matrix so we need to think of a way to turn this into a quadratic matrix of form $\\text{grains} \\times \\text{grains}$.\n",
    "For each grain we have a 3 dimensional reduction of its frequency bins which can be considered a 3 dimensional vector which can be considered a point.\n",
    "We can now calculate the distance of the 3 dimensional frequency point to all the other 3 dimensional point representation of each grain.\n",
    "By doing this for each grain we can convert $T$ to a $\\# \\text{grains} \\times \\# \\text{grains}$ matrix $D$ which we can use as a transition matrix $P$ for a markov chain for the scheduling of grains by nomalizing the rows (which we will do in SC).\n",
