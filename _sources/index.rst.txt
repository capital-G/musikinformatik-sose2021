Musikinformatik SoSe2021
========================

Welcome to the course **Musikinformatik** of the `Robert Schumann Hochschule Düsseldorf <https://www.rsh-duesseldorf.de/>`_ for SoSe 2021.
The goal of this course is to introduce and learn common data analytic tools and machine learning algorithms for generating sounds.
It will not just take a look at the practical aspects of this endeavor but also discuss philosophical and mathematical aspects of
the discussed problems.

Within the course we will rely on the programming language `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_  - a high level scripting language -
which became a per-se standard for data analytics and machine learning over the last years.

We will also rely on the sound platform `SuperCollider <https://supercollider.github.io/>`_ for
generating sounds.
